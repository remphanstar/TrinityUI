## Current Progress & Issues (as of June 30, 2025)
*This section was appended by GitHub Copilot (chatGPT) for project status tracking.*

- **Notebook Refactor:** The TrinityUI notebook is now a robust, Colab-compatible, and user-friendly 3-cell notebook:
  - **Cell 1:** Infrastructure setup and debug UI (production-ready, robust, improved error handling and output visibility).
  - **Cell 2:** Configuration hub and Gradio interface (production-ready, robust, improved status display, prevents duplicate UI).
  - **Cell 3:** Asset download and WebUI launch (logic is correct, but cell content is currently corrupted and must be manually replaced with the provided working template).
- **UI/UX:** Major improvements to CSS/JS asset loading, debug interface, and output visibility. All outputs are robust and user-friendly.
- **Logging & Error Handling:** Logging is now robust, with errors visible in both logs and UI. Log sync to JavaScript is protected against crashes.
- **Colab Compatibility:** Addressed port conflicts, subprocess handling, memory management, and path issues for Colab environments.
- **Known Issues:**
  - Cell 3 content is corrupted and must be manually replaced with the working template (provided in project notes).
  - Further UI/UX polish and documentation of known limitations is optional but recommended.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Finalize and commit the notebook filename change for clarity and repo tracking.
  - (Optional) Further polish UI/UX and document known limitations.
